## About Me

💻 Currently a student pursuing a degree in Mathematical Sciences and Artificial Intelligence in Rome. 

🪐 I'm deeply fascinated by the potential of technology and science, and I enjoy exploring innovative projects that expand my horizons.

🎨 Committed to making meaningful contributions to every task undertaken, I like to use my graphic design skills to add a creative flair too. 

Beyond academic endeavors, you could catch me ballin’ on the court ⛹️ or vibing to music 🎧.

Feel free to reach out for further discussions or potential collaborations!
