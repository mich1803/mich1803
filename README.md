## About Me

Currently a student pursuing a degree in Mathematical Sciences and Artificial Intelligence in Rome. 

I'm deeply fascinated by the potential of technology and science, and I enjoy exploring innovative projects that expand my horizons.

Committed to making meaningful contributions to every task undertaken, I utilize my graphic design skills to infuse creativity. 

Beyond academic endeavors, I find enjoyment in listening to music and playing basketball.

Feel free to reach out for further discussions or potential collaborations!
